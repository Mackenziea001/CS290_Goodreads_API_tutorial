	  <h2> Why Goodread's API </h2>
	  <p> The Goodreads API allows users to access almost all information about books, authors, users, reviews, lists, quotes, and so on that are accessible through the site. The Goodreads API allows access to this information through several dozen methods. These can be used to edit the a Goodreads user's bookshelves, get information about other users, search for books and authors, and a variety of other useful activities. The official Goodreads iOS and Android apps exclusively use the API. It is also used to <a href = http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201734030> integrate with the Kindle </a> and some <a href = http://www.mcpl.us/> libraries </a>, (check the "Staff Reviews" section). Goodreads has more than 30 million members and 900 million books registered, so use of it's API provides access to an impressive chunk of data. </p>
	  <h2> Why Not Just Use the Official Documentation </h2>
	  <p><a href = https://www.goodreads.com/api> The official Goodreads API documentation </a> lists every method and is an excellent reference. It is mostly correct. Unfortunately, it is not especially accessible to beginners, largely due to its patchwork implementation of JSON in addition to XML, unclear parameter terms, use of OAuth, and lack of demonstration of the API methods. This brief guide is a complement to this useful but limited documentation provided by Goodreads and should act as an introduction to using the Goodreads API for beginners. </p>
	  <h2> What Does This Guide Cover </h2>
	  <p><a href = getting_a_key.html> Getting A Key </a> will show how to sign up for a Goodreads key, show how it's used, and explain some of the requirements Goodreads has set in place for those requesting a key. <a href = goodreads_api_methods.html> Goodread's API Methods </a> will provide a review of the Goodreads API and what you'll want to know before getting started. There are demonstrations of four methods: <a href = find_books_by_title_author_or_isbn.html> Find Books by Title, Author, or ISBN </a>, <a href = paginate_an_authors_books.html> Paginate an Author's Books </a>, <a href = get_reviews_for_a_book_given_a_title.html> Get Reviews for a Book Given a Title </a>, and <a href = get_a_users_review_for_a_given_book.html> Get a User's Review for a Given Book </a>. </p>
	  <p>Simply due to the quantity of Goodreads API methods available, this brief guide won't be covering all of them. The four methods covered provide examples, but do not cover all aspects of Goodreads or it's API. Specifically, this brief introductory guide will not cover methods using OAuth. However, most API methods do not require OAuth, so unless you would like submit information to Goodreads, this introduction should be sufficient. </p>
